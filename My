{Key Concepts (Simple Definitions)
1. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Simple definition: Instead of the AI making things up, it first looks up relevant information from your documents, then uses that to answer.
Example: Like open-book exam vs. closed-book. RAG lets the AI check its notes!
2. LLM (Large Language Model)
Simple definition: The AI brain (like ChatGPT) that reads text and generates responses.
Example: OpenAI's GPT-4, Claude, etc.
3. Vector Database
Simple definition: A special storage system that remembers the meaning of text, not just the words.
Example: It knows "car" and "automobile" are similar, even if the words are different.
How it works: Converts text → numbers (vectors) → stores them → finds similar meanings quickly.
4. Embeddings
Simple definition: Converting text into a list of numbers that capture its meaning.
Example: "I love pizza" → [0.2, 0.8, 0.1, ...] (1536 numbers for OpenAI embeddings)
5. Multi-Agent AI (CrewAI)
Simple definition: Multiple AI agents working together, each with a specific job.
Example: Like a team where one person researches, another writes, another edits.
